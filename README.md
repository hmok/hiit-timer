Welcome to the **HIIT Timer**!

A simple timer for **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)** workouts.

- **How it works**: Click 'Start' to begin. Each set includes:
  - 20 seconds of intense exercise
  - 10 seconds of rest
  - Repeated for a total of 10 sets.

This project was inspired by the [Tabata Workout](https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=Tabata+Workout&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) and includes a few customizations for enhanced functionality.

Special thanks to ChatGPT for support in building this app.
