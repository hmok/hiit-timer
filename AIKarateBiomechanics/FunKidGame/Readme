Fun Kid Game here is the intro:

https://hmok.github.io/AIKarateBiomechanics/FunKidGame

I've added five fun tasks for the children to interact with:

1. **Arms Up!**: Kids raise their arms to see the "Arms Up!" message.
2. **Jump!**: When the kids jump, a "Jump!" message appears.
3. **Touch Toes**: Kids touch their toes to see "Touch Your Toes!".
4. **Side Stretch**: When they stretch sideways, they see "Side Stretch!".
5. **Wave!**: Kids can wave their hands to see "Wave Hello!".

These activities are designed to be easy, fun, and engaging, helping children stay active while interacting with the game. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
