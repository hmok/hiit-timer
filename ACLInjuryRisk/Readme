<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #555;">This is a simple calculation designed to help prevent ACL injuries during landing from a height. Jumping and subsequent landing, as well as potential changes in direction, can put significant stress on the ligaments, including the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which is particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #555;">Scientific evidence suggests that when the knee flexes or bends beyond 30 or 40 degrees, the ACL becomes looser and less stressed. This raises an important question: how much should we lower our hips or overall body position to achieve this desirable knee flexion angle and enhance the protection of the knee ligaments?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #555;">Assuming the body height is represented as 'h' and the knee is positioned midway between the ankle and hip, we can determine the required hip displacement using the formula: <strong>x = (h / 2) - (h / 2) * sin((180 - &theta;) / 2)</strong>. Here, &theta; represents the knee flexion angle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #555;">By inputting someone's height, we can provide a rough estimation of how much that person needs to lower their hips (bend their knees) to protect the knee. It is important to note that this is a simplified calculation, and seeking advice from experts is highly recommended. However, research supports the idea that bending the knee can serve as a preventive measure against ACL injuries.</p>
