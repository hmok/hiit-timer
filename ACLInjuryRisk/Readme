# ACL Injury Prevention during Landing from a Height

This is a simple calculation designed to help prevent ACL injuries during landing from a height. Jumping and subsequent landing, as well as potential changes in direction, can put significant stress on the ligaments, including the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which is particularly vulnerable.

## Overview

Scientific evidence suggests that when the knee flexes or bends beyond 30 or 40 degrees, the ACL becomes looser and less stressed. This raises an important question: how much should we lower our hips or overall body position to achieve this desirable knee flexion angle and enhance the protection of the knee ligaments?

## Calculation Formula

Assuming the body height is represented as 'h' and the knee is positioned midway between the ankle and hip, we can determine the required hip displacement using the formula:

x = (h / 2) - (h / 2) * sin((180 - θ) / 2)  

Here, θ represents the knee flexion angle.

## Estimation

By inputting someone's height, we can provide a rough estimation of how much that person needs to lower their hips (bend their knees) to protect the knee. It is important to note that this is a simplified calculation, and seeking advice from experts is highly recommended. However, research supports the idea that bending the knee can serve as a preventive measure against ACL injuries.
